# EVETrade.space Release Notes

### V7.1

    * V7.0.11: Updated timeout from 30 seconds to 120 seconds for larger queries.
    * V7.0.10: Added trade preferences for station or region hauling trades. Included additional stations and systems (ie: Thera) that were not showing up. Limit results to the top 1,000 most profitable.
    * V7.0.9: (Bugfix) Route Chunking to avoid ES maxClauseSize of 1024
    * V7.0.8: Added a jump route cache which improves performance for hauling trade requests by an average of 50%. Average requests were between 10-20 seconds and this has shrunk to 5-10 seconds.
    * V7.0.7: (Bugfixes) Using static S3 resources rather than a resource API to minimize exceptions (Thanks to @Megakaktus @Heaths and @k3v on Discord for submitting this bug)
    * V7.0.4: System to System trading has been reintroduced on the station-to-station trading page. Improved UI from the legacy application collapses all stations on the UI to a single row.
    * V7.0.3: (Bugfix) Station to Station Haul Market Depth improperly linked to incorrect page when multiple TO or FROM stations were selected.
    * V7.0.2: (Bugfix) In the event of a failed request, 3 retries should take place, and then an error modal should display.
    * V7.0.1: (Bugfix) Submitting forms would refresh on Firefox due to not preventing the default action (Thanks to k3v on Discord for submitting this bug)

    * Refined the build process to be more developer focused
    * Created a structure and pipeline for open-source development
    * Added the ability to select buy/sell orders at start or end station
