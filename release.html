### V6.2
    * Adding additional external applications (Windows, OSX, and Linux)

### V6.1
    * Fixed a bug where nothing but SELL ORDERS to BUY ORDERS would return the proper results. [Now that it works, we have to give this warning. Be sure to understand the nature of your query. If you request too much information by widening your filters, this may crash your browser.]

### V6
    * Refined the build process to be more developer focused
    * Created a structure and pipeline for open-source development

    * Filter now applies to 14-day moving average rather than the last 24 hours to provide better results.
    * Region Trading security filter defaults to NULL Sec or better to accomodate queries with null-sec regions selected (otherwise no results are returned).
    * Checkbox added to Region Trading to include/exclude citadels in results
    * Number of results per page increased from 50 to 100
    * Minor styling changes to make results appear better on smaller desktop/laptop screens.

    * Added systems trading capability
    * Removed redundant code.
    * When refreshing the table, existing results remain until new ones are found.
    * Due to demand, trade hubs are temporarily added back in. This will eventually become the last 5-10 most recent trade selections.
    * Added table pagination back in for queries that result in over 50 trades so as not to break browsers.
    * Loading indicator in top right added to know that results are still being added while you scroll.
    * Highly anticipated beta version of the region-to-region feature is now live.

### V4
    * Continuing progress towards Region-Region trading by allowing multiple starting locations.
    * Cutting down on spam items that provide unreasonable results.
    * Mobile responsiveness updates for the input dialogue
    * Tabbing now works between input dialogues and buttons
    * If an endpoint is just typed into the endpoints dialogue it is also considered for the trade (users do not need to click Add Station for just one station).
    * Users had trouble learning of the order investigation function, added a magnifying glass to each row to show all orders
    * Users complained about the interface to add custom stations so now these sections are all fill-in-the-blank
    * Completely removed custom section. Performance should drastically improve now that these sections are not being generated in HTML.
    * Complete back and front end refactoring to promote future feature viability and allow for region to region trading in the next update.
    * Revised frontend based on user feedback (moving away from white).
    * Improved performance and more results provided (ensuring every page of data is returned now).

    * Minor performance gains due to refactoring 3-year old code.
    * Allow users to refresh the table with the last query they submitted.
    * Added user analytics when selecting different options to better track user perferences and prioritize bugs.
    * If an endpoint fails that many times that means its probably not up.
    * Improved number of results for station trading

    * Probably the biggest request of the server has finally been added. You may now station trade and filter by the current daily volume.
    * Bug fixes for firefox where backspace would not work
    * Bug fixes for safari where you could not use margin
    * In light of EVE Crest being shutdown soon. The entire website is now ESI compliant.

    * These features is in BETA as the EVE CREST API does not currently support getting all these stations so we are working off of a fixed backend, please report any bugs you find
