# EVETrade.space Announcements

## **Important: Site Closure Notice**
*Posted: July 19, 2025*

Hey all, a bit of sad news. 

After more than a decade of running EveTrade, I've made the difficult decision to close the site within the next year. This wasn't an easy choice, but the time and effort required to keep things running no longer outweighs the financial and time costs.

**The site will officially close its doors on April 1, 2026 (maybe sooner).**

I've listed the domain EveTrade.Space for sale on Namecheap. If someone purchases it, the domain will transfer immediately to them. Please note that this sale does not include the services, but all of the underlying code is open-source on Github for anyone who wishes to rehost them.

Until the site is sold, or on April 1, 2026, I'll continue to keep EveTrade.Space operational in my spare time.

I want to extend my deepest gratitude to each and every one of you for your incredible support over the past decade. It's been an amazing journey, and your engagement made EveTrade.Space what it was. Thank you for being such a fantastic community.
