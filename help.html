# EVETrade.space Help

## What is EVETrade.space?

The EVE Online trading tool that lets you discover what to trade between stations and regions. This tool enables making ISK through hauling or station trading.

## Trading Information

### Route Hauling

Find best trades between two trade hubs. Buying sell orders at one, and selling them directly to buyers at the other. These trades can happen immediately.

For more information see: [Hauling 101](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Hauling_101)

#### Station to Station

Use this tool to find the best trades between two *or more* stations.

#### Region to Region

Use this tool to find the best trades between any two regions.

#### System to System

In order to add systems, simple click the `Add System` button on the station trading page.

### Station Trading
Placing buy orders at a station for the buy price. Once the buy order is filled, you sell the items at the same station for the cheapest price. This is a slower process but requires nothing but capital. No ships or storage requirements.

For more information see: [Station Trading 101](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Trade_102:_Station_Trading)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I enjoyed the previous version of EVETrade.space, why did you change it?**

> In order to be more equitable to people with lower-end computers, we streamlined the process to be more performant and take the load away from the browser. 
> We also implemented a number of fixes and system overhauls in order to provide a better user experience in the future. 
> This will allow for new features to be introduced which were not possible in the original website (ie: Citadel trading).

> If you really want to use the old website please visit [legacy.evetrade.space](https://legacy.evetrade.space)

**Why are we not able to trade between multiple regions?**

> That computation is taxing, and not realistic. If you are not in the given region (or nearby), you will not be able to trade it, and by the time you reach the region the items will likely be gone. We are working on a system to provide route based trading, but that is still under development.

**Where can I provide feedback?**

> There are two ways:

> 1. You can visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/awhipp/evetrade) page and create an issue

> 2. You can visit our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9xZh5qKCeR) and chat with the community there.
