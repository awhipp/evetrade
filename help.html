## Trading Information

### Route Hauling

#### What is Route Hauling?

Route hauling is a method of moving goods in EVE Online that involves planning a specific route and transporting goods along that route. This method of hauling is often used for moving goods across multiple systems or regions, as it allows players to transport large quantities of goods in a systematic and efficient manner. Players typically use freighters, which are large, slow-moving ships with high cargo capacity, to haul goods over long distances.

#### Station-to-Station Hauling

Station to station hauling involves moving goods between two stations within the same system. This type of hauling is often used to transport goods within a single system or between systems that are close together. Station to station hauling can be done using smaller, faster ships with lower cargo capacity, such as industrials or blockade runners. However, larger hauls may require the use of freighters.

#### System-to-System Hauling

System to system hauling involves moving goods between two different systems in EVE Online. This type of hauling is often used to transport goods between systems that are not connected by stargates. To accomplish this, players use jump freighters, which are freighters that have the ability to jump between systems using jump drives. Jump freighters are typically used for hauling larger quantities of goods, and they require careful planning to ensure a safe and efficient route. In order to add systems, simple click the `Add System` button on the station trading page.

#### Region-to-Region Hauling

Region to region hauling involves moving goods between two different regions in EVE Online. This type of hauling is often used to transport goods over long distances, such as from high-sec to null-sec space. To accomplish this, players may use jump freighters or freighters and plan a route that takes advantage of available stargates and safe spots. Region to region hauling is the most complex and dangerous type of hauling, as it involves traveling through potentially hostile space and avoiding gate camps.


### Station Trading

#### What is Station Trading?
Station trading is a form of trading in which players buy and sell goods within a single station. This is different from other forms of trading, such as regional or interregional trading, which involve moving goods between different stations or systems.

In station trading, players monitor the market within a single station, looking for profitable opportunities to buy and sell goods. This requires a deep understanding of the market, including the supply and demand of different goods, the pricing trends of different items, and the strategies of other traders.

#### How Does Station Trading Work?
The first step to station trading is finding a station with a thriving market. This typically involves looking for stations that are located near popular mission hubs, where players are constantly buying and selling goods.

Once you have identified a station with a good market, you can begin monitoring the prices of different goods. This involves using tools such as EVE-Central or the in-game market interface to track the prices of different items over time.

When you find an item that is selling for less than its market value, you can buy it and then resell it at a higher price. This requires a good understanding of the market, as well as the ability to predict which items are likely to increase in value over time.

To maximize profits, station traders often use a variety of tools and techniques, including market manipulation, price fixing, and speculation. These strategies can be risky, but they can also be highly profitable for skilled 

### Are character skills taken into consideration?

By default, character skills are set as if you have not trained. If you want to take into consideration character skills, you can set the various dropdowns to reflect your character.

### Security Status Definitions

In EVE Online, system security refers to the level of security present in a given star system, which affects the level of aggression players can expect from NPC (non-player character) security forces, as well as the types of activities players can engage in within that system.

The security level of a star system is denoted by a number between 0.0 and 1.0, with 1.0 being the highest level of security and 0.0 being the lowest. The higher the system security level, the stronger and more responsive the NPC security forces are to player aggression.

System security levels also affect the types of resources and activities that are available in a given system. High-security systems (with security ratings of 0.5 or higher) tend to have more stable economies and are better suited for peaceful activities like mining and mission-running, while low-security and null-security systems (with security ratings below 0.5) offer higher risk and reward opportunities such as PvP combat and rare resources.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I enjoyed the previous version of EVETrade.space, why did you change it?**

> In order to be more equitable to people with lower-end computers, we streamlined the process to be more performant and take the load away from the browser. 
> We also implemented a number of fixes and system overhauls in order to provide a better user experience in the future. 
> This will allow for new features to be introduced which were not possible in the original website (ie: Citadel trading).

> If you really want to use the old website please visit [legacy.evetrade.space](https://legacy.evetrade.space)

**Why are we not able to trade between multiple regions?**

> That computation is taxing, and not realistic. If you are not in the given region (or nearby), you will not be able to trade it, and by the time you reach the region the items will likely be gone. We are working on a system to provide route based trading, but that is still under development.

**Where can I provide feedback?**

> There are two ways:

> 1. You can visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/awhipp/evetrade) page and create an issue

> 2. You can visit our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9xZh5qKCeR) and chat with the community there.
