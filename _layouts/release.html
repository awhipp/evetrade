## About

Implements the EVE ESI API to find:

    * the best margins inside your own station.
    * the best trades between stations.
    * the best trades between systems.
    * the best trades between regions.

Select which of the station you are docked in. It will return a lazy-loaded table of trades you can make at other station. Allows table sorting on any of the fields to see what items are selling at your hub for a low price and can be sold at another hub for a higher price.

### V6.2
    * Adding additional external applications (Windows, OSX, and Linux)

### V6.1
    * Fixed a bug where nothing but SELL ORDERS to BUY ORDERS would return the proper results. [Now that it works, we have to give this warning. Be sure to understand the nature of your query. If you request too much information by widening your filters, this may crash your browser.]

### V6
    * Refined the build process to be more developer focused
    * Created a structure and pipeline for open-source development
    * Added the ability to select buy/sell orders at start or end station

### V5
    * Station Trading now includes 14 and 30 day moving averages for volume.
    * Filter now applies to 14-day moving average rather than the last 24 hours to provide better results.
    * Region Trading security filter defaults to NULL Sec or better to accomodate queries with null-sec regions selected (otherwise no results are returned).
    * Checkbox added to Region Trading to include/exclude citadels in results
    * Number of results per page increased from 50 to 100
    * Minor styling changes to make results appear better on smaller desktop/laptop screens.
    * Citadels now can appear as starting locations
    * Security Status color now appear in regional trades (and filtering)
    * Number of Jumps and Profit per Jump included for Regional Trades
    * Standalone windows application released to BETA.
    * Added public citadels to the region-to-region trading query
    * Added systems trading capability
    * Removed redundant code.
    * When refreshing the table, existing results remain until new ones are found.
    * Due to demand, trade hubs are temporarily added back in. This will eventually become the last 5-10 most recent trade selections.
    * Added table pagination back in for queries that result in over 50 trades so as not to break browsers.
    * Loading indicator in top right added to know that results are still being added while you scroll.
    * Highly anticipated beta version of the region-to-region feature is now live.

### V4
    * Continuing progress towards Region-Region trading by allowing multiple starting locations.
    * Cutting down on spam items that provide unreasonable results.
    * Mobile responsiveness updates for the input dialogue
    * Tabbing now works between input dialogues and buttons
    * If an endpoint is just typed into the endpoints dialogue it is also considered for the trade (users do not need to click Add Station for just one station).
    * Users had trouble learning of the order investigation function, added a magnifying glass to each row to show all orders
    * Users complained about the interface to add custom stations so now these sections are all fill-in-the-blank
    * Completely removed custom section. Performance should drastically improve now that these sections are not being generated in HTML.
    * Complete back and front end refactoring to promote future feature viability and allow for region to region trading in the next update.
    * Revised frontend based on user feedback (moving away from white).
    * Improved performance and more results provided (ensuring every page of data is returned now).
    * Packaged volumes are now taken into consideration.
    * Minor performance gains due to refactoring 3-year old code.
    * Allow users to refresh the table with the last query they submitted.
    * Added user analytics when selecting different options to better track user perferences and prioritize bugs.
    * If an endpoint fails that many times that means its probably not up.
    * Improved number of results for station trading
    * Numbers were flipped for buy and sell orders
    * Probably the biggest request of the server has finally been added. You may now station trade and filter by the current daily volume.
    * Bug fixes for firefox where backspace would not work
    * Bug fixes for safari where you could not use margin
    * In light of EVE Crest being shutdown soon. The entire website is now ESI compliant.
    * Also reduced amount of network traffic required.
    * Fixed a bug where the best price was not actually returned.
    * Users were being confused with the sell/buy terminology so it now reads whether you are looking at the buy orders or the sell orders
    * Announce when EVE servers are not connecting properly
    * Able to export the tables to CSV, Excel, or PDF
    * Able to print or copy to clipboard as well

    * We have added filtering to the table to enable users to filter on station, item, or any other text within the table

    * Also added custom select station trading
    * These features is in BETA as the EVE CREST API does not currently support getting all these stations so we are working off of a fixed backend, please report any bugs you find
